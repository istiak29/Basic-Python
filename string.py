String is a set of all character. It contains all values.
Important thing is * Anything inside the quotation mark will consider as a string. 5 is a number or it
is int value but '5' this 5 is a string.
There is a case where we have to use apostrophes within my string so if it happens you should use double
quote to define the string and then you can use apostrophes. For example, "It is Istaik's notebook"
