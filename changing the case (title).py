.title() it is a method
In your programme you have to recognise something (PythoN or pYthon or PYTHON or else) and if you
want to see them as like as Python so in that case .title() method will help you to do this.
**We can define method by the parenthesis. Methods do extra work so method need extra information for there work. In the
parenthesis we actually tell the method what to do.**
But if the method do not need extra information then we can leave the parenthesis as empty.
Here we can see that the parenthesis is empty, so we can assume that in this portion we do not need any
extra information so as well as we leave the parenthesis as it was like that.

.title() change the first letter of a word and whatever it is, .titlle() will change make it upper.
Until the sentence over it will change every first letter of every word.
